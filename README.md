# End-of-field2 (July 6th 2020) (Yaay!)

## The challenge

In this exercise we have been building two full integrations of interfaces handed over by the coach of Becode.
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface we had to:

Create a standard html page based on several template (replace [filename] with the filename of the mockup image you are building):
Create a standard style.css stylesheet and link it to the html page
Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided mockup images.

Each learner has been assigned two simple interfaces, and a more complex one. You may choose to build the two simple ones, or one simple AND the complex one.

All the files fot this clallenge have been saved on github, using the version control software of git! 

## The two results

i've chosen to do two "simple" interfaces in order to reach HTML5 and CSS3 level 1 batch.

## Big thanks so far to Manuele & Tim for all the feedback!!
